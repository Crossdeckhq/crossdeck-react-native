/**
 * Public, typed accessor for the bank-grade behavioural contracts
 * this SDK ships. The full architecture — schema, distribution,
 * audit loop, pillar taxonomy — lives in `contracts/README.md`
 * at the monorepo root.
 *
 * Why a typed surface (vs. plain JSON access): contract IDs and
 * pillar names are part of Crossdeck's public commitment to
 * customers. Reading them through `CrossdeckContracts` means the
 * compiler catches drift the moment a contract is renamed or
 * retired. Tools that consume contracts at runtime (dashboards,
 * AI assistants, customer integration tests) get the exact same
 * shape every SDK ships, with no parsing layer to drift.
 *
 * --- BINARY STABILITY ---
 * `Contract` is treated as an evolving — but back-compat — wire
 * shape. Fields may be added in any minor release. Existing
 * fields will not be removed or repurposed except in a major
 * version bump, even if all known contracts stop using them.
 * Customers can rely on `id`, `pillar`, `status`, `appliesTo`,
 * `codeRef`, `testRef`, `registeredAt`, `firstRegisteredIn`,
 * and `bundledIn` being present on every contract in every
 * future minor/patch release of this SDK.
